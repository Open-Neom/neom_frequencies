# neom_frequencies
Frequency Management for Open Neom.

neom_frequencies is a specialized module within the Open Neom ecosystem, dedicated to managing and displaying
detailed frequency information. It serves as a complementary component to the broader functionality provided
by neom_generator, focusing on the visualization, organization, and interaction with frequency data.
This module is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Open Neom platform, adhering to its modular
architecture and Clean Architecture principles.

🌟 Features & Responsibilities
neom_frequencies is responsible for:

•	Frequency Visualization: Providing detailed displays of frequency data, including waveforms, spectrograms,
    and other visual representations to enhance user understanding and interaction.

•	Frequency Organization: Enabling users to categorize, tag, and manage their frequency presets for easy access and retrieval.

•	Interactive Controls: Offering intuitive UI elements for adjusting frequency parameters, such as amplitude, duration, and modulation.

•	Integration with neom_generator: Seamlessly connecting with the neom_generator module to fetch and display real-time frequency
    data generated by the "Neom Chamber."

•	User Customization: Allowing users to save personalized frequency settings and create custom frequency profiles for different use cases
    (e.g., meditation, focus, relaxation).

•	Data Persistence: Supporting local storage of frequency presets and configurations, ensuring user preferences are retained across sessions.

📦 Installation
Add neom_frequencies as a Git dependency in your pubspec.yaml file:

dependencies:
    neom_frequencies:
        git:
            url: https://github.com/Open-Neom/neom_frequencies.git

Then, run flutter pub get in your project's root directory.

🚀 Usage
neom_frequencies is designed to be consumed by the main application (neom_app) and other modules requiring detailed frequency management.
Below are examples of how to integrate and use its features.

Example 1: Displaying Frequency Data
Dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:neom_frequencies/ui/frequency_page.dart';

class MyFrequencyView extends StatelessWidget {
    const MyFrequencyView({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
    
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold(
            body: FrequencyPage(), // Displays the detailed frequency visualization
        );
    }
}

Example 2: Integrating with neom_generator
Dart
import 'package:get/get.dart';
import 'package:neom_frequencies/domain/frequency_controller.dart';
import 'package:neom_generator/generator/ui/neom_generator_controller.dart';
    
class MyIntegratedController extends GetxController {
    final FrequencyController _frequencyController = Get.find<FrequencyController>();
    final NeomGeneratorController _generatorController = Get.find<NeomGeneratorController>();
    
    void updateFrequencyDisplay() {
        _frequencyController.updateFrequency(_generatorController.currentFrequency);
    }
}

Example 3: Registering Dependencies
Dart
import 'package:get/get.dart';
import 'package:neom_frequencies/data/frequency_repository.dart';
import 'package:neom_frequencies/domain/frequency_controller.dart';

class FrequencyBinding extends Bindings {
    @override
    void dependencies() {
        Get.lazyPut<FrequencyRepository>(() => FrequencyRepositoryImpl());
        Get.lazyPut<FrequencyController>(() => FrequencyController());
    }
}
